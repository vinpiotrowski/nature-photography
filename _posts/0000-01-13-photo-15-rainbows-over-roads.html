description: "<strong>Ft. McLeod Alberta</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;A rainbow is just light, and even then, light that's kind of reflected a little bit.&nbsp; They're nice to look at but all the talk regarding magic, ponies, and symoblism is overdone.&nbsp; When you look at this photo just pretend the rainbow is like any other element in the composition (you don't want them getting more conceded than they already are)."
