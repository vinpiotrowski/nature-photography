description: "<strong>MD of Ranchlands Alberta</strong>&nbsp; Some people might not believe this photo was taken in Alberta Canada. Many photographers just stare at Alberta's mountains and don't pay attention to the Grasslands or Badlands which are special too. This particular area of the province feels very modest and I can't wait for summer to get back there."
