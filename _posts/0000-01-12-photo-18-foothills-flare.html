title:  "Millarville Alberta | Foothills Flare"
description: "<strong>Near Millarville Alberta</strong>  I normally don't point my lens into the sun like this but sometimes you gotta do what you gotta do. In this case I wanted to capture the dandelions lighting up and I believe the flare conveys the intensity of the sunset and serves to remind us that we work with glass and light."
alt: "The sunset was gorgeous and doing a tremendous job of back-lighting these dandelions near Millarville Alberta."
