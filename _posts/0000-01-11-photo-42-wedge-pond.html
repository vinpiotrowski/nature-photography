title:  "Kananaskis Alberta | Morning at Wedge"
description: "Wedges are great! They've been used throughout history to lift, separate, and hold objects in place because of their mechanical advantage. This composition is formed with a large wedge; it was taken at Wedge Pond; and I had a wedge of pie for Canadian Thanksgiving later in the day."
alt: "A picture of Wedge Pond taken at sunrise with pink clouds that appear to be shooting out of Mount Kidd."
