description: "I really enjoyed my trip to Vancouver Island. One of my favorite activities was walking along the beach checking out the tide pools. Since I came from the land-locked Prairies the idea of being near water with whales, sharks, and jelly-fish blew my mind.  Sadly, none of the tide pools contained sharks."
