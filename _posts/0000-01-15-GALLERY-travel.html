description: "Nature and scenery aren't aware of man-made constructs like international borders. Many of my favorite scenes spill over from Canada into the United States and many of the landscape photographers that inspire me come from the Pacific Northwest. Over the last few years I've taken several trips to see the sights in person and there are still dozens of locations I'm planning on visiting."
summary: "The Pacific Northwest is home to incredible scenery like rolling hills, prehistoric coastal forests, and the continuation of the Rocky Mountains. Many of the photographers that inspire me live in this area."
