description: "<strong>Kananaskis Alberta</strong>  I drive by Barrier Lake all the time in winter and it looked like most of the snow had melted on it. After the sun went down it got so windy I started drifting across the ice."
alt: "On my way home from the ski hill I swung by Barrier Lake because the cloud cover looked good for a sunset."
