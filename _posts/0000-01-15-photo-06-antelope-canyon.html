title:  "Antelope Canyon | Shapes and Colours"
description: "The mercury was getting dangerously close to -40 C in Canada so I decided to make like a goose and fly South. Glad I did; Antelope Canyon is one of the most beautiful places I've been. The colours, lines, and shapes are completely surreal."
alt: "Antelope Canyon in Arizona is now one of my favorite places in the world.  The lines, lights, and colours that fill the canyon are simply amazing."
