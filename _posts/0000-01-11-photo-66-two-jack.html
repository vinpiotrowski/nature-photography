description: "I like different lakes in Banff for different reasons. Two Jack Lake is cool because of this little island. Whenever I take pictures here I always cross the log and something about having water on all sides is neato. Maybe one day I'll build a tree fort and live on the island."
alt: "One of my favorite lakes to photograph around the town-site of Banff is Two Jack Lake."
