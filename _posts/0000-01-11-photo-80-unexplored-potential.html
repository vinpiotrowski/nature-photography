description: "Banff National Park Canada  This was my first trip to Moraine Lake. When I came over the hill the scene was absolutely unbelieveable! I'd seen pictures but had no idea how gorgeous the hue of the water framed by those mountains is in person.  This was one of my first photos that didn't look like it was taken by a drooling monkey."
