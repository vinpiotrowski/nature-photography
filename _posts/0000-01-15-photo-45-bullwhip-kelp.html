title:  "Tofino British Columbia | Bullwhip Kelp"
description: "This seaweed was washed up everywhere and it was solid and rubbery. At one point I thought that if I was stranded on an island I would contruct a set of Nunchaku from the plant so I could hunt wild pigs and fend off pirates with it. Alas, my trip went as planned and I didn't have to resort to any Ninjutsu survival tactics."
