title:  "Emerald Lake Canada | Hourglass Figure"
description: "I'm pretty sure this was the calmest morning of all time. The water was very still and had some steam coming off of it when the sun began to rise. There wasn't a sound to be heard the whole time I was there and it was great."
alt: "A sunrise landscape photograph taken on Emerald Lake in Yoho National Park during a calm morning with reflective water and mist combined with floating debris like logs and drift wood."
