description: "Every morning when I woke up on the island it was incredibly foggy. So foggy that if a grey donkey was laying on the beach I probably would have tripped over it. In the evenings the sky would clear and the sunsets were incredible. I really like the way the shape of the water reminds me of a starfish which were attached to the rocks in the area."
alt: "During my stay in Tofino I witnessed really incredible sunsets but I think this one takes the cake."
