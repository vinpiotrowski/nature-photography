title:  "Palouse Washington | Palouse Falls"
description: "Palouse Falls are nearly 200 feet high and it seems like an entire ocean must flow over them every minute. I couldn't believe when I read that Tyler Bradt went over in a kayak and lived. There are also no fences on the 400 foot cliff so if you're afraid of heights this probably isn't a good place to hang out."
