description: "A couple of months ago I was thinking about Fall in the Canadian Rockies and was picturing myself in front of Lake O'Hara. When I checked in to the reservation system I was reminded of an insanely popular restaurant that only has three tables and a line outside the door at all times. So I decided to stay along Icefields Parkway instead and was able to catch some beautiful scenery -- no tie or reservations required."
