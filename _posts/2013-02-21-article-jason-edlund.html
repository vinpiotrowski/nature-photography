                <p>There are many photographers who enjoy shooting in the Canadian Rockies but I’m sure you’ll agree that the work of Jason Edlund truly stands out.</p>
                <p>One of the reasons Jason’s work is so compelling is his tendency to shoot off the beaten path. A lot of the areas he photographs require hiking, camping, and knowledge of the back country to get to. His photos of Mount Assiniboine Park make a visit very tempting and his pictures have brought international awareness to the area.</p>
                <p>When photographing familiar places Jason Edlund sees them in new and refreshing ways. I've seen countless shots from Mistaya Canyon but none of them resemble the capture on the right.</p>
