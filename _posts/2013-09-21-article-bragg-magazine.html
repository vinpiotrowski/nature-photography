        <h1 style="font-size: 49px;">How to get noticed... or not.</h1>
        <p>I'll probably always classify myself as an aspiring photographer even if I become world famous. I've had some very positive affirmations recently, even some commercial success, and I've been thinking about getting my name out there more. Then I started thinking about why I got into photography; is it because I wanted to develop amazing social media strategies? Is it because I wanted to spend all my time at the printers? When I really thought about it I decided that what I love doing is getting out in nature and taking pictures -- screw becoming famous! I have the feeling that if I keep doing what I'm passionate about the rest will figure itself out and I'll be happier.</p>
