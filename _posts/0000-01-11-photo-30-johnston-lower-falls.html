title:  "Banff Canada | In the Pines"
description: "Banff National Park Canada  The thing I like about this picture is how well the textures play off each other (the rough pine bark and the smooth flowing water). I was originally tempted to shoot between the trees but I pictured my corpse splattered on the rocks below and settled on this shot."
