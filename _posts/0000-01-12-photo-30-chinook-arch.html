description: "Sometimes I'll be sitting at home being lazy when I notice an incredible sunset is starting to happen.  I drive out and look for foregrounds close by -- the literal interpretation of this photo is cow-food underneath some pretty clouds."
alt: "When we get chinook winds in Alberta there seems to be a pretty high probability of good sunrises/sunsets."
