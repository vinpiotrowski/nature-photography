title:  "Lake O Hara | Mt Cathedral"
description: "Despite what it looks like in the picture Mt. Cathedral isn't actually an erupting volcano. During a rather nice sunrise I was photographing Lake O'Hara then I saw the sun hitting Mt Cathedral and I booted it to the other shore to catch the reflection."
alt: "A nice sunrise was lighting up the skies around Lake O Hara then I turned around and saw what was happening on Mt Cathedral.  The light was amazing."
