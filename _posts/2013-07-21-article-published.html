            <p><strong>Published</strong> I have an article in the latest issue of Landscape Photography Magazine. Iâ€™ve actually written a couple articles for them and although my column is stuck way in the back somewhere I feel really lucky to be in the same magazine as the likes of Guy Tal, Ian Plant, and a slew of other internationally recognized photographers.</p>
            <p>If you look at the newsstand and are turned off by a bunch of mags designed to fill your camera bag and empty your wallet, with more advertisements than content, you should pick up Landscape Photography Magazine. Simply put LPM plasters their pages in beautiful images from cover to cover. If I were putting together a magazine I would use the same format: lots and lots of really great photos and a couple words to glue everything together. The whole reason I got into photography was because I like looking at pictures. Am I right?</p>
