description: "<strong>Banff National Park Canada</strong> I figured that as an Alberta photographer it was about time I took some pictures of Mt Rundle. I started driving to Banff (about an hour away) whenever the weather forecast looked promising. You know what they say about eighth time being lucky and it happened to be Valentines Day too."
