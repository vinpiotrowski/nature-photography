description: "<strong>Kananaskis Alberta</strong> Elbow Falls are a popular place for Calgarians to have a pic-nic on the weekend. Although there was only one other person there on this night I should have Photoshopped in some stoned teenagers going over the falls in a Dingy to make it more authentic."
