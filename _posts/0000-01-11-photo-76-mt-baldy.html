title:  "Kananaskis Alberta | Baldy Over Barrier"
description: "There are signs in this picture that it may have been cold when it was taken; the snow on the ground, the wind shaped drifts, and the lack of palm trees. It was a chilly one for sure but I hardly noticed my fingers going numb because the scenery was so damn nice."
alt: "Winter shot taken from Barrier Lake with Mt Baldy on the horizon and some wicked snowdrifts in the foreground."
