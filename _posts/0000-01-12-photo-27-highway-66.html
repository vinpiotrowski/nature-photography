title: "Bragg Creek Alberta | Highway 66 Sunrise"
description: "<strong>Kananaskis, Alberta</strong> I was on my way to work when I was faced to make a decision. Sunrise was starting and it looked like it was going to be a good one. I could stop and take photos or I could be on time for work. I stand by my choice."
alt: "I got to work late this morning because I had to pull over to take some photos.  A good reminder of why you should always have a camera on you."
