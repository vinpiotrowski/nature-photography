title:  "Palouse Washington | Remembering"
description: "Just before I left for my trip to Palouse I learned that my Grandpa had passed away. He followed the cowboy lifestyle, was always pleasant to be around, and a great inspiration of how to live life. When I was taking this picture I was thinking of him and figured the wild flowers and sunset are a nice way of remembering."
