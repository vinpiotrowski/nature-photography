description: "I moved to the Alberta Foothills after deciding that the burly mountain lifestyle was more my thing. I live on an acreage just outside the Hamlet of Bragg Creek. Surrounded by old growth deep forests, open alpine meadows and majestic mountains, Bragg Creek is a kind of heaven.  I love hiking close to home and my dog likes inviting the local wildlife over to party. The quiet, peacefulness, and star filled night skies have really grown on me."
summary: "Where the Rocky Mountains meet the boreal forest and where I call home. With its abundant wildlife and plant life this is a place where all of us can connect with the natural world."
