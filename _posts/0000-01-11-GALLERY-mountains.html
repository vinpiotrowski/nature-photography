title: "Canadian Rockies Photo Gallery"
description: "The way I see it mountains are the best subject matter for landscape photographs. They embody the rugged outdoors lifestyle and take the viewer back to a time before modernization, to a place of refuge and discovery, full of tangible forms that rekindle our close connectedness with nature and the outdoors. On the down side predatory wildlife, avalanches, severe cold, and giant crevasses are all trying to kill you while you enjoy the nice views."
summary: "Photos of mountains, lakes, and waterfalls taken from the national and provincial parks of Western Canada. This particular gallery is rife with scenery that fits the archetypal postcard image and embodies the rugged outdoors lifestyle."
