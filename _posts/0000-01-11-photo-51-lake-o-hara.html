description: "I spent a couple nights at Lake O'Hara in British Columbia. It was very cold during this sunrise and I think it translated well into the image. Also feelings of loneliness and longing. Look at me expressing myself with my camera!"
alt: "I spent 3 very cold nights at Lake O'Hara in Yoho National Park Canada.  Although the lighting wasn't great I still got some great shots."
