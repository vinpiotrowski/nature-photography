title:  "Moraine Lake Canada | On Canada Day"
description: "I spent Canada Day watching the sun rise over Moraine Lake, which in classic Canadian fashion, is still producing snow in July!  This is one of the most incredible places on Earth especially at sunrise. In a few short hours the buses will roll in, the parking lots will fill up, and this place will be bustling with a million tourists. I'm glad I got there before they did."
