        <p>I'm a software developer who loves the outdoors, design, and art. It was only a matter of time before I figured out that I could combine all of my hobbies into one mega-hobby that I've dubbed Phodlor. Nowadays, my passion for Phodlor takes me to beautiful places during the "magic hours" when scenery looks its best. Although the act of taking photos is more exciting than practicing choke holds on a Grizzly Bear it's being out in nature that's the real draw for me.</p>

        <p>Sometimes I wish I was raised in the wilderness by a pack of wolves but my upbringing was fairly commonplace. My family did a lot of camping so I've always had an appreciation for nature and the outdoors which I'm grateful for. In my twenties I rediscovered hiking and began taking pictures with my camera. When I saw other people's landscape photos taken at sunrise I knew I was going to have to start heading out earlier.</p>
        <p>I don't consider myself a pro but I strive to shoot at an adept level. My favorite photos show landscapes in new ways, usually complemented with vibrant colour, and characteristics of surrealism. Most of my work is captured from the Alberta Prairies and the Canadian Rockies and is pretty wide-open as far as post-processing goes. Part of the joy of photography is being involved in the community and seeing other people's work that inspires me.</p>
