description: "The Alberta Prairies are close to home and offer a lot of diversity in atmosphere and mood. There's a certain feeling of freedom that comes with the open spaces, rolling hills, and endless fields. Unobstructed views of the sky provide awe-inspiring sunrises/sunsets and the proximity to the mountains means heart-pounding storms. Abandoned buildings, rusting agriculture equipment, and bleak colours can be captured to portray a darker temperament."
summary: "Delapidated fences, barns, and fields are featured in this gallery. Themes of farming and agriculture are almost unavoidable when photographing the Alberta Prairies because of their effect on the landscape."
