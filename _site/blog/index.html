        <h3>3 years in the making.</h3>
        <p>I’d been wanting to go to Lake O’Hara for 3 years but it’s insanely hard to get a reservation out there. They have 30 sites, you can book up to 3 months in advance, and they recommend you start trying 3 months to the day. They only take phone reservations and it’s very hard to get through. Even if you do it’s typical for all of the sites to be booked within the first hour.</p>

        <h3>Hoping to strike gold.</h3>
        <p>To make things even more difficult I wanted to go when the larch trees were turning yellow. Although a conifer, the larch is a deciduous tree and loses its leaves in the autumn. Nature photographers think of these trees like beer; They look good, they smell good, and you'd crawl over your own mother to photograph one! Unfortunately the lighting wasn't great so now I have a reason to go back next year.</p>

        <h3>It's everywhere you want to be.</h3>
        <p>The camp is located about 10 minutes away from Lake O'Hara itself. The lake is glacier fed and looks amazing. That's not all though! There are lots of hiking trails that start near the lake and lead to magical places filled with waterfalls, more lakes, fantastic views, and unicorns (probably). Some of the trails are very restricted and only 4 groups are allowed to hike them per day.</p>

        <h3>Cold temps and community camps.</h3>
        <p>The campground is community based with a shared fire pit.  At night everyone would gather around and share stories about where they've been.  I ended up meeting two awesome people: <nobr><a title="Dani Lefrancois Photography" href="http://www.photographybydani.com/">Dani Lefrancois</a></nobr> and <nobr><a title="Callum Snape Photography" href="http://www.callumsnapephoto.com/">Callum Snape</a></nobr>; both of which are incredible photographers.  Even though I thought I might die of hypothermia at times it was an amazing trip.  I will definitely be heading back.</p>

                <p>When I was starting out I came across Dan's photos and was instantly amazed. At the time he was doing some heavy processing and I found his images incredibly imaginative and it made me rethink what an artist could convey through photography.</p>
                <p>Dan has since toned down his processing but his images are more powerful than ever in terms of expression and mood. While most of the photographers I follow are shooting famous scenes Dan is out scouring the Prairies and I often find his work more intriging and just as stunning.</p>

            <p>I've always wanted to visit Vancouver Island, which is almost as far West as you can go in Canada. It houses wicked coastlines, ancient cedar forests, and armies of wildlife. If it were a nation their flag would feature an otter surfing on a killer whale and they would be led by a bear instead of a person. I stayed on the North end of the island near a small town called Tofino which is moderately transient and full of tourists and surfers.</p>

            <p>This wasn’t meant to be a photography trip; I pictured overcast skies and only brought my camera just-in-case. I booked a flight to Comox British Columbia, rented a car, and drove across the whole island which was crazy beautiful. I highly recommend renting a car because the trip would take forever in a golf cart. During my driving adventure I saw several bears, passed through Cathedral Grove, and went by some gorgeous lakes.</p>

            <p>I caught a water taxi to Refuge Cove, which is inaccessible by land vehicles, for a short hiking trip. On my way I passed by sea otters (which float on their backs while holding hands to form rafts) and a pod of killer whales. It really feels like civilization hasn’t been there long enough to screw it up yet.</p>
            <p>The native culture is celebrated in the area too. The Haida are known for Totem Poles and their art which features psychedelic beavers. I read up on them and they’re like the vikings of pre-Canada. Their war canoes were built out of cedar trees and some were large enough to accomodate 60 viking-like paddlers.</p>

The food truck behind the surf shop had world class fish tacos. The accomodation was celebrity worthy. My favorite moments though were walking along beaches with my friend. We would look in tide pools and pet the starfish then RUN LIKE HELL FROM THE RISING TIDES!. One of the best trips I’ve been on.</p>

        <h1 style="font-size: 49px;">How to get noticed... or not.</h1>
        <p>I'll probably always classify myself as an aspiring photographer even if I become world famous. I've had some very positive affirmations recently, even some commercial success, and I've been thinking about getting my name out there more. Then I started thinking about why I got into photography; is it because I wanted to develop amazing social media strategies? Is it because I wanted to spend all my time at the printers? When I really thought about it I decided that what I love doing is getting out in nature and taking pictures -- screw becoming famous! I have the feeling that if I keep doing what I'm passionate about the rest will figure itself out and I'll be happier.</p>
