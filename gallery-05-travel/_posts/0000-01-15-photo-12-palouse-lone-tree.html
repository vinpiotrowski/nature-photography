description: "Palosue Washington USA  It's tempting to post a billion photos of this region because it's so incredible. I feel kind of guilty though because it's almost like a wildlife photographer taking pictures in a zoo; the area is so perfect, and there are so many great photos to be had, that it feels like cheating."
alt: "This area of Washington is one of my favorite places to take pictures.  This Palouse shot features a lone tree and a road with yellow sunrise light."
