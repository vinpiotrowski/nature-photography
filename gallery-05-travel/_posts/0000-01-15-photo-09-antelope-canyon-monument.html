title:  "Upper Antelope Canyon | Monument Valley Abstract"
description: "This shot is a bit like a turducken... it's an abstract shot of a Monument Valley sunrise, but it was taken in a canyon, which is located in a desert (70 miles West of the Colorodo Plane that is home to Monument Valley).  The analogy is complicated and made more sense to me when I was taking the picture :)"
