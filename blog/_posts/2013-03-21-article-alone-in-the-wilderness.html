description: "Sometimes I think about leaving society, growing a beard, and living in the forest; Richard Proenneke did just that and he is now one of my heroes. His story is very inspirational and the guy is just plain awesome."

                <p>"It was good to be back in the wilderness again, where everything seems as peace. I was alone - just me and the animals. It was a great feeling - free once more to plan and do as I pleased. Beyond was all around me. My dream was a dream no longer."</p>

            <p>I don't like shopping malls; the crowds and consumerism make me cranky. It's not that I want to become a hermit, I'm a joyful social person, but sometimes the thought crosses my mind. During these introspective moments I realize that it doesn't take a lot of money to enjoy the things I love (family, friends, my dog, nature) and I wonder why I'm working so hard. Modern society is full of distractions.</p>
            <p>Then one day I was watching PBS and caught the story of Richard Proenneke. At age 51 he relocated to Alaska, where he lived for 30 years in solitude, in a cabin he built with his own hands. His story was amazing; a man focused on the one thing we hardly think about in modern society: survival. With less distractions he found pleasure in simple things like encountering wildlife or homemade berry syrup.</p>
            <p>I'm working to appreciate the simple things more and trying to avoid modern distractions. If you're like me then I'd recommend watching "Alone in the Wilderness".</p>
