description: "I wanted to shoot a scene with mossy rocks, waterfalls, and yellow leaves. I remembered this spot that feeds Upper Kananaskis lake and it had mossy rocks and waterfalls. What? You don't have a backpack stuffed full of leaves when you go hiking?"
alt: "A picture of some yellow autumn leaves placed in front of waterfalls that feed Upper Kananaskis Lake with moss covered rocks throughout."
