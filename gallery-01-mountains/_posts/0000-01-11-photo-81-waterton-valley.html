description: "Waterton is one of my favourite places in Alberta.  It's always windy there but there are lots of wildlife and incredible hiking trails.  It's beautiful in all seasons but I sure like going during Autumn during the shoulder season when there are less people.  Can you find the historic Prince of Wales hotel in this picture?"
