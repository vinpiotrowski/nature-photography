description: "When Autumn hit in Kananaskis I was driving out after work every day to take pictures. I wasn't having much luck with the weather so I decided to practice my abstracts.  The panning effect is inetentioanl; yup, I didn't just drop the camera.  This photo has always been one of my personal favorites."
