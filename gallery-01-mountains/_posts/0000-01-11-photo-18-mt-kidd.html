title:  "Kananaskis Alberta | Burst of Winter"
description: "Ten inches of snow is pretty-much indistinguishable from ten feet when you`re walking on it. My first few steps were good, then I was sinking to my knees, then I fell to my waist. I got to this spot by flopping on top of the snow like a giant tripod carrying sea-manatee crossing dry land."
