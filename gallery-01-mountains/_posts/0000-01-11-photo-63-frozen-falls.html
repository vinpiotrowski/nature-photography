title:  "Banff Canada | Frozen Falls Under Stars"
description: "These falls are located a ways up a snowy mountain. Most people shoot them from the ground but the people who are adventuress enough to climb are rewarded for their effort. With a beautiful view? No, with an awesome 500 MPH slide ride down."
alt: "These falls are at the end of the Lake Louise opposite the Fairmont Hotel.  They freeze in the winter and have a beautiful blue colour."
