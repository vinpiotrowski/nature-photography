description: "The Alberta Landscape is incredibly diverse but few people outside of the province are aware of the Badlands. The area is famous for having lots of dinosaur bones but the rock formations and hoodoos, created through a thousand million decades of rain and erosion, are otherworldly and the big draw for nature photographers.  Being remote means the night sky is free of light pollution."
summary: "One of my favorite areas to shoot because it feels otherworldly. The Alberta Badlands are filled with desert scenery, venomous creatures, and dinosaur bones."
