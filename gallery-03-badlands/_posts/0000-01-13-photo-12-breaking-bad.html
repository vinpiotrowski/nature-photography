title:  "Dinosaur Provincial Park Alberta | Breaking Bad"
description: "On my visit this year I went on a guided hike into the forbidden area of the park where we visited a dig site with real dino bones (they were literally just sticking out of the ground). The tour guide provided interpretive dances to explain how glaciers created the area and I levelled up my dinosaur science which is always nice."
